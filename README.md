# 🌍 Space Trip  

**Space Trip** is a web platform that allows users to explore and plan trips to popular destinations on Earth (and potentially in space in the future! 🪐).  

---

The application offers:  
✅ Adding and editing user-defined travel locations 🌍  
✅ Browsing an interactive map with marked destinations 📍  
✅ Rating and reviewing places ⭐  
✅ Generating suggested travel routes 🗺️  
✅ Integration with map APIs (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)  

This project is built with **Angular 19**, using the modern **Standalone Components** approach.

## 🚀 Development server  

To start a local development server, run:  

```bash
  ng serve
```  

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## 🏗️ Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
  ng generate component component-name
```  

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
  ng generate --help
```  

---

## 📦 Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
  ng build
```  

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

---

## 🧪 Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
  ng test
```  

---

## 🛠️ Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
  ng e2e
```  

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
